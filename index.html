    <h1>Introduction:-</h1>
    <p>The former Portuguese enclave of Goa, midway down India’s southwest coast, has been a holiday destination since colonial times, when British troops used to travel here from across the country for a spot of “R&R”. Back then, the three Bs – bars, brothels and booze – were the big attractions. Now it’s the golden, palm-fringed beaches spread along the state’s 105 km coastline that pull in the tourists – around two million of them each winter. Cheap air travel has made it a major package tour destination for Europeans, and there has been a dramatic rise in domestic visitors in recent years.</p>
    
        <h2>Attractions:-</h2>

        <p>The three must visit places in Goa are :-</p>
        <ol>

            <li>Calangute Beach</li>
            <br>

            <p>Calangute Beach is unarguably one of the best places to visit in north Goa, fringed with coconuts and palm trees along the coastline. It forges the real attraction of Goa, courtesy of the water activities, nightclubs, restaurants, and shacks. Furthermore, though commercialised, its unstrained solitude and alluring views of locales enfold a serene ambience, making it an ideal hotspot for nature freaks.

            <li> <b>Respect Local Customs:</b> Goa is a culturally diverse destination. While swimwear is acceptable at the beach, it's respectful to cover up when leaving the beach or visiting religious sites. Modest dress is appreciated in towns and villages.</li>

            <li><b>Beach Safety: </b>When swimming in the sea, be mindful of strong currents, especially during the monsoon season. Always follow lifeguard instructions, and if you're not a strong swimmer, stay in the shallower waters. It's also a good idea to wear sunscreen to protect your skin.</li>

            <li><b>Bargaining at Markets:</b> Goa is famous for its vibrant markets. When shopping at local markets, don't hesitate to haggle for better prices. Bargaining is a common practice, but do so with respect and a smile. It can be a fun part of the shopping experience.</li>
